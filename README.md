# Birds of a Feather

## Introduction
This is a social Android app that allows the user to connect with other students that they have shared classes with. The user will create a profile with their name, profile picture, and past classes taken. The app will then allow them to use Bluetooth to search for nearby students that have shared or currently share a class with them, saving discovered students into session data for reloading. The user can sort the discovered students by different criterias, as well as adding students to their "favorites" list or "wave" at a student to send them a notification.
